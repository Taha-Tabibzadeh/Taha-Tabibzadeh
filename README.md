<h1>Hi there ðŸ‘‹</h1>

<p align="justify">Hello, Iâ€™m <a href="http://tabibzadeh.com">Taha Tabibzadeh</a>. My academic background is in structural and earthquake engineering, but my passion for the world of programming led me to pursue this field. In recent years, I have strived to build a bridge between these two worlds and enjoy walking across it.</p>
